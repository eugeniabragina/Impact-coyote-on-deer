This code runs the analysis for a study: 2019. E.V. Bragina, R. Kays, A.W. Hody, C. Moorman, C. Deperno, L.S. Mills. Effects 
on white-tailed deer following eastern coyote colonization. Journal of Wildlife Management. 83(4): 916-924
One piece of the code analyses the impact of coyote arrival on white-tailed deer male harvest and another piece does the same for 
the total deer harvers in the Eastern US in 1981-2010. Underlying question is how much coyotes impact deer at the Eastern US  
and whether coyotes are able to control deer population. This analysis show that there is no evidence for the coyote control.
You will need 'Total_harvest.csv' and 'Buck_harvest.csv', respectively.
